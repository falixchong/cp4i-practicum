# Topic 1: Introduction and Scenario Details
Your customer has been a long-time user of **App Connect (IIB/WMB)** and **MQ**. They have recently decided to investigate the value of modernizing their integration. They are eager to explore IBM Agile Integration practices. They would like you to use one of their existing flows and queue definitions to explore how to move to containerized integration.

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/scenario3-image1.png?raw=true)

While eager to understand the modernization journey, they also have reservations on their ability to scale and manage the workload.  Demonstrate how to analyze, componentize, and containerize existing integration artefacts, and illustrate how to scale and monitor the new deployments.

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/scenario3-image2.png?raw=true)



**Your Challenge**

Your team have (5) days to document your approach to a Solution to the customer’s business problem using CP4I capabilities and any external capabilities that you think are necessary or useful.
Demonstrate your practical solution to whole class.

Day 5: Demonstrate your practical solution to whole class.

# Topic 2: Introduction to Clusters and Openshift

## Clusters and Openshift

### Introduction to Cluster

If you're completely new to the concept of clusters, do follow the quick and easy tutorial [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) to learn more
> With Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud®, you can create highly available clusters with virtual or bare metal worker nodes that come installed with the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Container Platform orchestration software. You get all the advantages of a managed offering for your cluster infrastructure environment, while using the Red Hat OpenShift tooling and catalog that runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for your app deployments.


### Introduction to Openshift

OpenShift is a platform that allows you to run containerized applications and workloads and is powered by Kubernetes. It is an offering that comes with Red Hat support, regardless of where you choose to run your applications and workloads. 

One of the big advantages of OpenShift is being able to take advantage of public and private resources which includes bare metal or virtualized hardware whether it is on-premise or on a cloud provider. 

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/openshift-overview.png?raw=true)

This is the high level OpenShift Container Platform overview.

For developers, OpenShift has two different ways of enabling them to work with their platform. They can take advantage of either the CLI or a web console.

# Topic 2: Solution Architecture
Below describe the high-level solution architecture for a simple scenario's solution.
By using IBM IIB/ACE transformation advisor's TADataCollector, we can analyse the current monolith IIB/ACE application. A report will be generated to recommend what are needed to refactor, in order to achieve a microservice architecture build.

The refactor code can later be deployed in a microservices architecture on Redhat Openshift with CP4I (ACE + MQ) environment

# Topic 3: Running Transformation Advisor

## Installing IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) & Running Transformation Advisor (TADataCollector)

1.	Install IBM App Connect Enterprise for developers (also called ACE). Make sure to select the correct download package for your OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).
Click on "Download" button on the following link:  https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/12.0?topic=enterprise-download-ace-developer-edition-get-started 
The version used in this practicum is `12.0.3`

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/AppConnect1.png?raw=true)

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/AppConnect2.png?raw=true)

   Complete the installation through the installer package you just downloaded for your OS.  eg: `12.0.3.0-ACE-MAC64-DEVELOPER-UNSIGNED`. You can use the IBM ACE Installation page as a guide to complete the installation.


2. Once installed, open the installed ACE toolkit. A view similar to the screenshot below will launch.

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/AppConnect3.png?raw=true)

4. IBM ACE console will launch on your screen as below:

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/AppConnect5.png?raw=true)

5. Run the Transformation Advisor by running `TADataCollector` on this console and passing Scenario3 Assets-IIB IIBV10_Broker_backup.zip file through command line, as shown below: 

```
TADataCollector ace run /<path_to_assets_on_local_machine>/IIBV10_Broker_backup.zip
```

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/AppConnect6.png?raw=true)

6. Once the `TADataCollector` command runs successfully, it will generate recommendation files under `/tmp/TADataCollector/output/IIB1` folder. Open the following directory to access the generated files

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/AppConnect7.png?raw=true)

7.	Open the recommendations.html file located in `/tmp/TADataCollector/output/IIB1` folder & Read the recommendations made by IBM Transformation Advisor

## Installing Cloud Pak for Integration on Openshift

### Obtaining and applying Entitlement Key

The IBM Entitled Registry contains software images for the capabilities in IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration. To allow the Cloud Pak for Integration operators to automatically pull those software images, you must first obtain your entitlement key, then add your entitlement key in a pull secret.

1. Obtain your entitlement key using the url - https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/EntKey1.png?raw=true)

2.	Your entitlement key must be added to the cluster as a pull secret to deploy Cloud Pak for Integration capabilities. You can either add a pull secret to each namespace you plan to use for Cloud Pak for Integration capabilities, or add a global pull secret, which enables deployment of Cloud Pak for Integration capabilities in all namespaces.	
Navigation --> Open Shift Container Platform --> Workloads --> Secrets --> On the top left you can see “Create” --> Click and select “Image Pull Secret” (**Ensure it’s your custom namespace under your project**)


![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/EntKey2.png?raw=true)

3. Add the details as shown in the snapshot below. In “Password” enter the entitlement key copied in Step – 1 and click “Create” the secret key.

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/EntKey3.png?raw=true)

4. Upon creation it will appear under your project.

![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/EntKey4.png?raw=true)

This section completes the configuration of Entitlement Key.

curl -v http://is-01-toolkit-request-app-3-http-cp4i.cp4intpg-wdc04-ttwakv-8946bbc006b7c6eb0829d088919818bb-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/responseService
```
```
curl -v http://is-01-toolkit-request-app-3-http-cp4i.cp4intpg-wdc04-ttwakv-8946bbc006b7c6eb0829d088919818bb-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/requestService
```

Please replace 
**http://is-01-toolkit-request-app-3-http-cp4i.cp4intpg-wdc04-ttwakv-8946bbc006b7c6eb0829d088919818bb-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud** part with the URL of your environment

## Running mq_ace_lab.mqsc

There are different layers of authorization and authentication configured on the Channel access. To simplify the exercise, we will proceed to disable to Channel security authentication and authorization with an MQ Script. Below steps will assist to disable - 

**Pre-requisite**

Install Openshift CLI client for your system by following the steps outlined in the below documentation

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html
 



1. Login to Openshift CLuster Environment. Click on the top right corner --> You Login ID will appear here --> Click copy login command


![alt text](https://github.com/falixchong/cp4i-practicum/blob/master/images/MQAC2.png?raw=true)

2. Browser will display "Display Token" --> Click to get your API Token

5. Run command as below to get the pod name of pod running MQ. Copy the pod name to be used later.

```
oc get pods|grep mq 

```
